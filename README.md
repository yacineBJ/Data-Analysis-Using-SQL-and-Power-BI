### Project Description: Data Analysis Using SQL for Exporting Views to Power BI and Visualizing Data with Power BI

#### Project Overview:
Welcome to my data analysis project focused on the Brazilian ecommerce public dataset provided by Olist Store. This dataset encompasses information on 100,000 orders placed from 2016 to 2018 across various marketplaces in Brazil. The dataset offers a multi-dimensional view of each order, including details on order status, price, payment, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. Additionally, a geolocation dataset relating Brazilian zip codes to latitude and longitude coordinates is included.

#### Project Objectives:
1. **Data Extraction and Transformation**:
   - Utilize SQL to extract and clean the data from the provided dataset.
   - Perform data transformation to create meaningful views that summarize key metrics such as order status distribution, average order value, payment methods, freight performance, customer demographics, and review sentiments.

2. **Exporting Views to Power BI**:
   - Export the SQL-generated views to Power BI for further analysis and visualization.
   - Ensure seamless integration between SQL and Power BI for efficient data transfer and updating.

3. **Data Visualization in Power BI**:
   - Create interactive and insightful dashboards in Power BI that provide a comprehensive overview of the ecommerce performance.
   - Visualize various aspects of the dataset including:
     - **Order Status**: Track the status of orders (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered) and identify any bottlenecks in the order fulfillment process.
     - **Sales Analysis**: Analyze sales trends, average order values, and total revenue over time.
     - **Payment Performance**: Evaluate payment method preferences
     - **Customer Insights**: Map customer locations, analyze purchasing patterns, and visualize product reviews to understand customer behavior and satisfaction.
     - **Geolocation Data**: Utilize the geolocation dataset to provide geographical insights and map the distribution of orders across Brazil.

#### Context:
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to sales channels effortlessly through a single 
contract. Merchants can sell their products via the Olist Store and utilize Olist's logistics partners for shipping. After a customer purchases a product, the seller is notified to fulfill the order. Upon receiving the product or when the estimated delivery date is due, customers are invited to complete a satisfaction survey via email, where they can rate their purchase experience and provide feedback.

#### Project Outcome:
By the end of this project, we aim to deliver a set of Power BI dashboards that provide actionable insights into the ecommerce operations of Olist Store. These dashboards will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
